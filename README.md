## Installation

To install the command line interface you can run the following command from the project's root directory:

```
$ go install pingthings/pingcli
```

## Command Line Interface

The CLI handles both serving and issuing requests to the server.

While serving you can use SIGINT (ctrl + c) to gracefully shutdown the server.
